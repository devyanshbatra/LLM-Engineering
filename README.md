# ðŸ§  LLM-Engineering

Welcome to **LLM-Engineering** â€” a curated collection of resources, experiments, and tools for working with **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. This repository focuses on the practical and technical aspects of LLMs, from core architecture and fine-tuning to deployment and evaluation.

ðŸš€ Overview

LLMs are transforming the landscape of AI applications â€” from chatbots and code generation to summarization and search. This repo dives into:

- LLM architectures and training pipelines
- Prompt engineering and few-shot learning
- Fine-tuning (LoRA, PEFT, QLoRA)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Model evaluation and benchmarking
- Scalable deployment (APIs, containers, quantization)
- Real-world use cases and experiments
